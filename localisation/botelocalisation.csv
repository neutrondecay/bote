BM_BOOTE_ERA;Beginning of the End;;;;;;;;x
BM_BOOTE_ERA_INFO;The medieval era is nearing its end, and the world is undergoing considerable change. In Europe, the grip of medieval thought is loosening within the Italian Republics, as groundbreaking discoveries and rediscoveries are made. Interest in Europe's Roman heritage is growing once again, which is introducing floods of radical ideas. Advancements in architecture, philosophy, art, politics and even language are all happening at an alarming rate. ;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_800075;Owain Glyndwr;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_800075;Owain Glyndwr was the last Welsh ruler to be crowned Prince of Wales. After decades of mistreatment by his English overlords, Owain had had enough. In 1400, he launched a rebellion against the English crown in order to gain independence for once and for all. Initially, he was highly successful, as the rebellion swfitly seized most of Wales. However, as time progressed, it was clear that the rebels could not be victorious. A lack of foreign allies and modern weaponry meant that the Welsh were finally defeated after a struggle which lasted until 1416. Nevertheless, Owain Glyndwr, or Glendower, was never found or betrayed by his fellow Welshmen, and he became a symbol of Welsh pride for centuries to come.;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_801171;Emir Timur;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_801171;Emir Timur (known as 'the Lame' due to his injuries) began life as the son of a prominent man in the Mongol Chagatai Khanate. Early on, he proved himself a talented commander in the service of the Chagatai Khan. After conquering and inheriting his own land, he consolidated power and reduced his liege to a figurehead, before expanding his empire rapidly. At its height, his empire encompassed lands in Persia, Anatolia, the Steppe and India. As a commander, he was undefeated, and is regarded as one of the greatest generals in history. He brought the Ottoman Empire to its knees, and only held off from destroying it completely because he chose to invade China before he died. By the time of his death, the last great nomadic conqueror had succeeded in uniting most of the Muslim world, and proved himself worthy of the title "heir of Genghis Khan".;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_800460;Sultan Bayezid of the Ottomans;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_800460;Sultan Bayezid 'the Thunderbolt' continued the Ottoman expansion across Anatolia and into Europe, striking fear into the Christian world and coming close to capturing Constantinople itself. He raised one of the largest known armies in the world at the time, but ultimately failed to take the City of the World's Desire. Although he was a talented commander, he was unfortunate enough to become a target for Timur, who reduced his Anatolian holdings to the disparate array of Turkish beyliks that it had been after the collapse of the Seljuk Sultanate. He was also known as a worldly man, engaging in debauchery and gluttony, but equally he spent much time dedicated to religious affairs, and kept theologians in his circle.;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_800388;Giovanni de' Medici;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_800388;Giovanni de' Medici was an Italian banker who began his family's rise to power in Florence. Having founded the Medici bank, his family became incredibly wealthy, despite Giovanni himself having only a modestly wealthy background. Through his financial prowess, his power in Florence increased, rivalling the leading families and driving the Florentine Renaissance forward. He was a patron of both the arts and the Papacy, which promoted the status of the Medici even further, the latter proving an invaluable ally. Nevertheless, Giovanni strove to maintain a positive public image by remaining humble and abiding to the law, which was key to the political success of the Medici- other families made the mistake of alienating the Florentine citizens. By his death, his son was well-placed to become the single most powerful man in all of Florence.;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_802720;Queen Margrethe of Denmark;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_802720;Queen Margrethe ruled over the kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden and Norway with great competence and ambition, often known as "Lady King", indicating that she was the equal of any male ruler. Her reign saw the union of the Nordic kingdoms under the Kalmar Union, which became by far the most powerful force in the Baltic. Although the Union was unpopular among many of Margrethe's rivals, her indomitable spirit and steadfast vision were formidable, and the unity of the Scandinavian kingdoms lasted for over a century. ;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_800975;Grand Duke Vasily of Muscovy;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_800975;Vasily continued the cosolidation of Muscovite power, ceasing to pay tribute to the Golden Horde for a few years while Timur wrought havoc among his Mongol rivals. He used a combination of diplomacy, warfare and intrigue to advance the Muscovite cause, forging alliances and conquering territories. Although he was unable to decisively rid himself of Mongol vassalage forever, the lands of the Rus' were closer to being united under Russian rule once again, as they had been many years ago. The journey towards Russian freedom continues.;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCbote.00001;You are Owain Glyndwr, a descendent of the Princes of Powys and a proud Welshman. And yet the English, who have no claim to these lands, continue to oppress your people. You have only ever served the Crown, but it affords you no respect. You refuse to put up with this for much longer.;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbote.00001;It is time for Wales to seize her own destiny.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbote.00002;As you are attending to a few administrative matters one morning, a servant bursts into your chambers, and announces that [c_powys.Holder.GetTitledName] has seized control of Aberystwyth! At once, you order the servant to prepare your horse. You plan to appeal to the English parliament.;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbote.00002;[c_powys.Holder.GetFullName] will pay for this!;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbote.00003;Your appeal has been made to Parliament, but after very little consideration, it appears that the Members of Parliament have entirely dismissed your concerns. This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbote.00003;That was the last straw.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbote.00004;Since Parliament has disregarded your appeal, you decide to take matters into your own hands. You sent a furious letter to [c_powys.Holder.GetFullName], reeling off a list of insults and threats. Perhaps it was a bit too much?;;;;;;;;x
